# NiteLyfe


This website allows users in the service industry to find events around the city of Atlanta (expansion will happen) that host special deals such as discounted drinks or food. People can look at different days of the week and see events happening on those days. They can also add their own submissions of cool events catering to those in the service industry. 

The purpose of this website is to really bring a sense of community amongst those that spend their days catering to others. It will be a way to network, job hunt, socialize, and just de-stress in an environment that's safe amongst peers that understand you.
